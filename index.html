      <p>Hello, I'm Travis! I'm 26 years old and I work in sheet metal manufacturing which is a family bussiness. I handle production, tool & die, and some machinist work. It's a good job and I truly enjoy mechanics but my true passion is technology! Outside of work you can usually catch me playing video games, bowling, or hanging out with my friends. The main video games I play would be Pokemon GO, Destiny 2, Smash Brawl, Rivals of Aether, or Old School Runescape. I'm an affiliate on twitch for streaming Old School Runescape. It was my career before getting thrown into the family factory, but it didn't necessarily pay the bills. </p>

      <p>That's why I decided to take the full stack flex computer coding boot camp at Case Western Reserve University. I'm a very hard worker and will do whatever I have to do to get the job done, it's accurate to say that I have that work ethic for any aspect of my life.</p>
